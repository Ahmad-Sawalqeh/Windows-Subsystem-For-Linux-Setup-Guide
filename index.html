                <ul>
                    <li>    
                        <label for="live-server">
                            <input type="checkbox" name="live-server"> Install and run live-server with a sample HTML file.

                    </li>
                </ul>

            <p> Once you have completed the above steps, try to figure out how to get 'live-server' from NPM running on your machince.</p>

            <p> There are instructions in the guide, but before you read those, try to figure out how you would get this up and running with this new WSL work-flow.
                This will give you the chance to safely play with things on both systems, teach you how to troubleshoot between the two, and ultimatly 
                will help strengthen your work-flow.
            
            </p>
            
            <h4> Some context on what live-server is:</h4>
            
            <p> <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server">Live-server</a> allows you to setup a simple development server which will load
                <a href="assets/index.html" download> a sample HTML page</a> 
                in your browser. It also has a hot-reload feature that detects when you make a change to a file, and automatically reloads the web page for you. 
            </p>
                
            <p> It uses NPM, but also makes use of your browser, so you must take those things into consideration when installing it and trying to use it. 
                NPM also uses a heirarchy structure when looking for packages. This means that it will look at your current working directory for the package first,
                and then look upwards until it reaches the top-most level. 
            </p>
            
            <p>    
                Note that NPM may exist on both the Linux side as well as the Windows side. How does the WSL work-flow 
                account for this? Which NPM should you use? Are you able to use the <code>--global</code> flag? Why or why not? 
            </p>

            <h4>Expected result:</h4>

            <p> You will know you are done when you are able to type <code>live-server</code> into your working directory's commandline and have it open the 
                sample HTML page, and hot-reload it when you make a change to the file.
