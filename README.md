This is an in-depth guide for new and experienced developers on how to get started with the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

WSL is a feature that allows Windows users to work with a native Linux distro that is directly integrated into Windows.

This is not a Virtual Machine, emulator, or a console wrapper; it is literally Linux inside of Windows, directly mounted to the Windows File System. This guide uses examples that are relevant to Node.js developers, but you can substitue your own tools into the workflow.

### YouTube Video Walk-Through
I created a set of videos which walked through the entire guide step by step, so you can see everything I do to get up and running! 

[YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixqKqHfCDWM&list=PLOOqtDuWOt4auhgOzv8NdCDhBYgblR6Fd&index=1) 

I highly recommend you watch the videos while you go through this guide! I talked a tad bit slower on purpose so you can watch them on 1.5x or 2x speed too :grin: !
