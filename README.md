The Windows Subsystem for Linux feature on Windows 10 enables users to have a Linux enviroment fully integrated into their Windows PC.

For ~~experienced~~ all developers: This is not a VM, a Dual-boot, or a console wrapper like Git Bash or Cygwin. It is a native POSIX environment directly mounted to your Windows File System.

I highly recommend you watch the videos while you go through this guide! I talked a tad bit slower on purpose so you can watch them on 1.5x or 2x speed too :grin: !

### Upcoming Additions:

#### Release date: 01/19

**Keep an eye out for an update! I will be working on this over the next few days and hope to have it completed by 1/13 or 1/20!**

Update: I will be updating this guide very soon now! I have been so busy with the Microsoft LEAP program, a job transition, as well as with learning C++ and C# that I haven't spent any time with WSL since July! Having said that, there are quite a few upcoming additions to this guide which will help with quality of life, guide readability, new vidoes, annotations, checklists, clairifications, and hopefully an exploration into any new major features!

Most importantly, I will be shoring up some areas that may be a struggle for new students and others new to WSL. One of the big ones is on how to use things like NPM for NodeJS: Where does global live, and how you should use it with the WSL workflow?

I will also be creating a requested video where I go through making an entire basic web app to show what the workflow looks like in a real life scenario!

Please make sure to request any thing else you would like to see and I will try to get it into the guide!

### Past Additions:

#### 7/18: 
- Getting new laptop on 7/1/18 and will update the doc in that month. ( Update coming soon! Videos will be included! Minor bug fixes! Delayed due to catcing a cold :feelsgood: :mask:. (DONE!)

- More links to all the resources that are used.
- Video demos, screen shots, and gifs to help visualize what's going on.
