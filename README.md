WSL is a feature that allows Windows users to work with a native Linux distro that is directly integrated into Windows.

This is not a Virtual Machine, emulator, or a console wrapper, it is literally Linux inside of Windows, directly mounted to the Windows File System. This guide uses examples that are commong to Node.js developers, but you can substitue your own tools into the workflow.
