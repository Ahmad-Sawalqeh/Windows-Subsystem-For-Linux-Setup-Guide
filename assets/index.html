    <h1>Sample HTML File!</h1>

    <p> If you opened this right after you downloaded it, you should see in the URL Bar that this is actually a flie that's been loaded into the browser straght from your hard drive.
        When you use live-server, the url bar will change to your ip on port:8080. When you see that, you will know that you have used live-server correctly!
    </p>
    
    <p> Once live-server is setup correctly, you should be able to make a change to this file in VSCode ( or which ever editor you're using ) 
        and see that change automatically updateded here when you save!</p>

    <p>Great job!</p>
